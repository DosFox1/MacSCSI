Modified code for the MacSCSI. 
Code cleaned up, errors and typos corrected, and edited to compile under version 5 of Aztec C for Macintosh. 

Original transcription can be found in the "MacSCSI Original Transcription Source Files", latest edited files can be found in "MacSCSI Source Files".
Use these only to compare the latest files.

## Important Note
This is the first attempt at compilation of the MacSCSI driver, and the DVR has been copied from the MacSCSI source file to a suitable system (System 2.0, disk image provided).    

**_THIS DRIVER IS UNTESTED AND UNLIKELY TO WORK AS IS._**


## Compilation Environment
Compilation environment is provided as a minimal system 7.5.5 disk image, with Aztec C version 5 and Macintosh Programmer's Workshop incldued.   
This is intended to be run under a Macintosh ii emulator (such as Mini vMac II), but can be compiled on a 68000 Macintosh if required.
